## Deploying Pods

Life of a pod

  * Pending : in progress
  * Running
  * Succeeded : successfully exited
  * Failed
  * Unknown

### Probes
  * livenessProbe : Containers are Alive
  * readinessProbe : Ready to Serve Traffic


### Resource Configs

Each entity created with kubernetes is a resource including pod, service, deployments, replication controller etc. Resources can be defined as YAML or JSON.  Here is the syntax to create a YAML specification.

**AKMS** => Resource Configs Specs

```
apiVersion: v1
kind:
metadata:
spec:
```

Spec Schema: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/multi-container/

To list supported version of apis

```
kubectl api-versions
```

#### Writing Pod Spec

Lets now create the  Pod config by adding the kind and specs to schme given in the file vote-pod.yaml as follows.

Filename: k8s-code/pods/vote-pod.yaml
```
apiVersion:
kind: Pod
metadata:
spec:
```

Lets edit this and add the pod specs

Filename: k8s-code/pods/vote-pod.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: vote
  labels:
    app: python
    role: vote
    version: v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: schoolofdevops/vote:v1
```

[Use this link to refer to pod spec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.9/#pod-v1-core)


### Launching and operating a Pod


To launch a monitoring screen to see whats being launched, use the following command in a new terminal window where kubectl is configured.


```
watch -n 1  kubectl get pods,deploy,rs,svc

```

kubectl Syntax:

```
kubectl
kubectl apply --help
kubectl apply -f FILE
```

To Launch pod using configs above,

```
kubectl apply -f vote-pod.yaml

```

To view pods

```
kubectl get pods

kubectl get po -o wide

kubectl get pods vote
```

To get detailed info

```
kubectl describe pods vote
```

```

Commands to operate the pod

```

kubectl logs vote

kubectl exec -it vote  sh


```

Inside the container in a pod

```
ifconfig
cat /etc/issue
hostname
cat /proc/cpuinfo
ps aux
```


### Exercise: Examine pods from the dashboard

### Port Forwarding

This works if you have setup **kubectl** on a local laptop.

```
kubectl port-forward --help
kubectl port-forward vote 8000:80
```

## Troubleshooting Tip

If you would like to know whats the current status of the pod, and if its in a error state, find out the cause of the error, following command could be very handy.

```
kubectl get pod vote -o yaml
```

Lets learn by example. Update pod spec and change the image to something that does not exist.

```
kubectl edit pod vote
```

This will open a editor. Go to the line which defines image  and change it to a tag that does not exist

e.g.

```
spec:
  containers:
  - image: schoolofdevops/vote:srgwegew
    imagePullPolicy: Always
```

where tag **srgwegew** does not exist. As soon as you save this file, kubernetes will apply the change.

Now check the status,
```
kubectl get pods  

NAME      READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
vote      0/1       ImagePullBackOff   0          27m
```

The above output will only show the status, with a vague error. To find the exact error, lets get the stauts of the pod.

Observe the **status** field.  


```
kubectl get pod vote -o yaml
```

Now the status field shows a detailed information, including what the exact error. Observe the following snippet...

```
status:
...
containerStatuses:
....
state:
  waiting:
    message: 'rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: manifest
      for schoolofdevops/vote:latst not found'
    reason: ErrImagePull
hostIP: 139.59.232.248
```

This will help you to pinpoint to the exact cause and fix it quickly.


Now that you  are done experimenting with pod, delete it with the following command,

```
kubectl delete pod vote

kubectl get pods
```

## Attach a Volume to the Pod

Lets create a pod for database and attach a volume to it. To achieve this we will need to

  * create a **volumes** definition
  * attach volume to container using **VolumeMounts** property

Local host volumes are of two types:  
  * emptyDir  
  * hostPath  

We will pick hostPath. [Refer to this doc to read more about hostPath.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath)


File: db-pod.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: db
  labels:
    app: postgres
    role: database
    tier: back
spec:
  containers:
    - name: db
      image: postgres:9.4
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
      volumeMounts:
      - name: db-data
        mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumes:
  - name: db-data
    hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/pgdata
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

To create this pod,

```
kubectl apply -f db-pod.yaml

kubectl describe pod db

kubectl get events
```

**Exercise** : Examine **/var/lib/pgdata** on the systems to check if the directory is been created and if the data is present.



## Creating Multi Container Pods

file: multi_container_pod.yml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web
  labels:
    tier: front
    app: nginx
    role: ui
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:stable-alpine
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /var/www/html-sample-app

    - name: sync
      image: schoolofdevops/sync:v2
      volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /var/www/app

  volumes:
    - name: data
      emptyDir: {}
```

To create this pod

```
kubectl apply -f multi_container_pod.yml
```

Check Status

```
root@kube-01:~# kubectl get pods
NAME      READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
nginx     0/2       ContainerCreating   0          7s
vote      1/1       Running             0          3m
```

Checking logs, logging in
```
kubectl logs  web  -c sync
kubectl logs  web  -c nginx

kubectl exec -it web  sh  -c nginx
kubectl exec -it web  sh  -c sync

```

Observe whats common and whats isolated in two containers running inside  the same pod using the following commands,

shared
```
hostname
ifconfig
```

isolated
```
cat /etc/issue
ps aux
df -h

```


## Exercise

Create a pod definition for redis and deploy.
